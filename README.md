# AI-Chatbot-Saas-using-MVP

I'm looking for a professional who could help me build an MVP for an AI Chatbot just like Chatbase using any of the open-source frameworks available just like Botpress.

The idea is to build this MVP quickly while allowing customers to try it within a couple of weeks max, after validation, we can expand that to a full time role.

If you have experience with such thing please hit me!

Note: I'm open to other suggestions of open-source software that does just that!
==================
To build a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for an AI chatbot, similar to Chatbase, using open-source frameworks such as Botpress, we can break down the solution into clear steps:
Steps for Building the MVP:

    Select the Framework:
        Botpress: Botpress is an open-source conversational AI platform, ideal for building chatbots with built-in NLP capabilities. It’s scalable and extensible, making it suitable for creating chatbots with AI and NLP features.
        Alternatives: You can also consider other open-source frameworks like Rasa or ChatterBot, but for this MVP, we'll use Botpress because of its ease of use, robust community support, and comprehensive feature set.

    Set up Botpress Environment:
        Botpress comes with a set of tools for creating and managing bots. You can create, train, and deploy bots with minimal configuration. Botpress uses Node.js as the backend, and bots are defined in a visual editor.

    Design the Core Features of the MVP:
        A conversational AI chatbot capable of handling FAQs.
        Integration with external APIs for information retrieval (e.g., weather, support tickets).
        Basic user authentication or personalization (e.g., storing user preferences).
        Analytics and reporting features to track user interactions (similar to Chatbase).

    Integrate OpenAI for Advanced NLP (Optional but recommended for richer conversation):
        To improve the chatbot's natural language understanding and generation, integrate GPT-3 or GPT-4 from OpenAI to handle more complex queries or generate contextually relevant responses.

    Testing and Deployment:
        Once the chatbot is built and the basic functionality is working, deploy it to a server (e.g., using Heroku, AWS, or Docker).
        Provide a simple interface for customers to test the chatbot via a web interface.

Code Implementation:

Here is a step-by-step approach to creating a basic MVP using Botpress and integrating it with OpenAI's GPT-3 for advanced conversational responses.
Step 1: Install Botpress

You can set up Botpress quickly by following the installation instructions from the Botpress documentation.

Installation on Local System:

    Download Botpress:
        You can download the latest version from the official website.
        Alternatively, you can use Docker for a quick setup. Run the following Docker command:

    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name botpress botpress/server

    Start the Botpress server:
        Run Botpress and access the bot admin dashboard at http://localhost:3000.

Step 2: Create Your First Bot with Botpress

    In the Botpress admin dashboard, click on Create a new bot.
    Give the bot a name, and choose the default template or a blank bot.
    Botpress provides a visual flow editor, where you can design the conversational flow (similar to Dialogflow or Chatbase).

Step 3: Integrate OpenAI GPT for NLP

To enhance the bot’s capabilities with GPT-3 or GPT-4, we’ll integrate the OpenAI API into the Botpress flow.

    Install OpenAI Library: If you're adding the GPT model directly into Botpress's code, you can use the openai library.

    pip install openai

    Create a Custom Action in Botpress:
        In Botpress, create a custom action to interact with the OpenAI API.
        Define the custom action in the actions folder of your bot.

    Sample Code for Custom Action in Botpress (in JavaScript):

// actions/gpt-3-action.js
const openai = require('openai');
openai.apiKey = 'your-openai-api-key';

async function askGPT(question) {
    const response = await openai.Completion.create({
        model: 'text-davinci-003', // You can use GPT-4 or GPT-3 models
        prompt: question,
        max_tokens: 150
    });

    return response.choices[0].text.trim();
}

// Action to be used in Botpress
async function gpt3Action(state, event, params) {
    const question = event.text; // User's question
    const gptAnswer = await askGPT(question);
    
    // Send GPT-3 response back to user
    return { text: gptAnswer };
}

return gpt3Action;

    Use the Custom Action in Your Flow:
        In the Botpress Flow editor, add an action node that calls gpt3Action.
        This action will send the user’s question to GPT-3 and receive a response.

Step 4: Deploy and Test the MVP

    Deploy to Cloud: Once the chatbot is built, deploy it on a platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud for public access. Botpress can be easily containerized with Docker and deployed to cloud services.
    Customer Testing: Create a simple web interface or integrate the chatbot with existing websites where customers can interact with the bot.

Step 5: Add Analytics and Reporting (Optional)

To add a feature similar to Chatbase (analytics and reporting), you can use services like Google Analytics or Botpress’s built-in analytics to track conversations, identify popular queries, and understand the user behavior.
Sample Project Structure:

    /bots: Contains the bot definition (flows, actions, etc.).
    /actions: Custom actions like integrating GPT-3.
    /data: Store user data, conversation logs, or preferences.
    /config: Botpress configuration files.
    /logs: Logs related to interactions and bot performance.

Step 6: Expand Based on Feedback

After receiving feedback from initial users, you can:

    Add more functionalities (e.g., user accounts, rich media support, integrations with other platforms).
    Improve the bot's conversational abilities with advanced NLP techniques or deeper integrations with external data.

Conclusion:

By following the steps outlined above, you can quickly build an MVP chatbot with AI-powered responses using Botpress and OpenAI's GPT. This MVP can be deployed and tested within a couple of weeks, and based on user feedback, you can expand the features or further enhance the chatbot. The use of open-source software ensures that you have full control over the system, and future improvements can be made based on the evolving needs of the users.
Alternatives to Botpress:

If Botpress doesn't meet your requirements, you could also consider:

    Rasa: Open-source machine learning framework for building contextual AI assistants.
    Dialogflow: While not open-source, it’s easy to use and integrates well with other systems.

Feel free to adjust the code and the process as per your specific needs!
